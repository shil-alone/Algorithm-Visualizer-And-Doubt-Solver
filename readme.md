Algorithm visualizer is a java based android application which is used to visualize various types of algorithms 
like quick sort , merge sort , insertion sort , selection sort , bubble sort, binary search , linear search etc. It will 
create a random array and draw the lines according to the size of the elements. As the algorithm executes it will 
color the comparison lines so that , user can see which comparison is going on . Also it colors the swapped lines 
so that swapping also can be visualized . Coloring all these steps will give us the brief idea about sorting and 
searching is done according to the algorithm

### Algorithms visualized are as follows :
**1. Binary Search**  
**2. Linear Search**  
**3. Quick Sort**  
**4. Merge Sort**  
**5. Selection Sort**  
**6. Insertion Sort**  
**7. Bubble Sort**
