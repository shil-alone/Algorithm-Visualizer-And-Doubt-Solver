Algorithm visualizer is a java based android application which is used to visualize various types of algorithms 
like quick sort , merge sort , insertion sort , selection sort , bubble sort, binary search , linear search etc. It will 
create a random array and draw the lines according to the size of the elements. As the algorithm executes it will 
color the comparison lines so that , user can see which comparison is going on . Also it colors the swapped lines 
so that swapping also can be visualized . Coloring all these steps will give us the brief idea about sorting and 
searching is done according to the algorithm
